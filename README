#Garapi
Garapi is an open visual graph editor base on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 technology. In the early stage, you can plot a normal function or point in to a *Catersian coordinate system* and export it as a image file. You can get your images easily without installing any tool except your built-in browser.

Current version: **Chaos *(1.2)***

#Features
In the current version, you can:

* Draw the graph of **normal** function. **Garapi** supports the following mathematical functions as well as their combinations: *sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), asin(x), acos(x), atan(x), abs(x), pow(x), log(x), ln(x), exp(x), sqrt(x)*.
* Plot a point into the graph. You can also customize the display of its label and coordinate.
* Moving, zooming your view port.

#Release path 
This is my expected release plan:

* 1.2: basic functionalities
* 1.3: implement setting dialog, enable saving setting and exporting function
* 1.4: write documentations and about
* 1.5 - 1.9: optimize code, fix bugs and improve the UI and UX.
